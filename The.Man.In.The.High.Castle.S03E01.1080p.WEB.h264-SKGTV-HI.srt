- It shows us winning the war.

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,250

- He's your father.

Your father is one of the most
powerful men in the Reich.

He could get you

Anything he wants to give me,

Racially desirable women

00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,390
- (phone ringing in distance)
- (distant whimpering, shouting)

496
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:18,600
(machine gun fire)

497
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,180
- (distant shouting)
- (machine gun fire)

498
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,640
(shouting)

499
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,400
(phone ringing in distance)

500
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,660
KIDO: They told me
not to waste my time

501
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,490
looking at your application.

502
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,410
Because I'm "hapa."

503
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,540
Hapa?

504
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,170
Hawaiian slang for...
kon-kétsuji.

505
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,340
So, American born

506
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,380
and half-white.

507
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,560
(chuckles)

508
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,360
(repeats Japanese phrase)

509
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,870
Where would your true loyalty
lie, Sergeant Nakamura-hapa?

510
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:24,660
With your Japanese father,
or with your mother's people,

511
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,460
who bombed this building

512
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,420
and killed the brave man
you hope to replace?

513
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:33,000
I only ask for an opportunity
to prove myself.

514
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,420
(machine gun fire)

515
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,220
KIDO: This morning,

516
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,980
the reprisals have prompted
a civic-minded citizen

517
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,310
to offer 
what may be a solid tip...

518
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:52,730
on one of the last rebel leaders
still at large.

519
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,740
(machine gun fire)

520
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,240
And Sergeant?

521
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,660
Yes, sir.

522
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,410
I cannot interrogate a corpse.

523
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,550
(horns honking)

524
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,810
(footsteps approaching)

525
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,640
SMITH: Joe.

526
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,900
Oberstgruppenfuhrer.

527
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,690
SMITH: So,

528
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:37,320
Reichsfuhrer Himmler
is sending you

529
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,280
to our embassy in San Francisco,

530
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,410
and I'm to provide
a plausible cover.

531
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,870
"Deputy Trade Attaché."

532
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,130
We'll furnish a clean passport
and the necessary credentials.

533
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,550
SMITH: Give us a couple of days
to get it all in order.

534
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,800
- Thank you, sir.
- The Reichsfuhrer's

535
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,220
got your future
all mapped out for you, Joe.

536
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,970
But I'll bet he didn't think

537
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,270
- about the present.
- Sir?

538
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,600
Some walking-around money.

539
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,900
Manhattan these days,

540
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,150
almost as expensive as Berlin.

541
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,990
Thank you, sir.
I'll pay you back.

542
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,780
I'm sorry about your father, Joe.

543
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,410
I'm sorry, too, sir.

544
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
About your son.

545
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,230
(elevator bell dings)

546
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,520
I want you to take care
of this personally, Erich.

547
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,320
Discreetly.

548
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,950
Yes, sir.

549
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,160
(footsteps receding)

550
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,290
TURNER: They can't pull
this shit on me last minute.

551
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,210
The Fritz Kuhn deal is my deal.

552
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:15,080
I don't need some German chick
fresh off the rocket plane

553
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,340
to tell me which way's up.

554
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,090
Nicole Dormer.

555
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,220
German chick.

556
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,510
Sorry.

557
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,350
Billy Turner.
Minister of Propaganda,

558
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,980
and world-class idiot.

559
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,440
Welcome to New York, Fraulein.

560
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,650
- First time?
- Hardly.

561
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,440
- Miss Dormer...
- Nicole.

562
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,280
Nicole. I think there are some
transatlantic crossed wires

563
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,240
on this little
renaming ceremony.

564
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,160
"Fascism is freedom"?

565
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,410
"Freedom to prosper."

566
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,160
"Freedom to explore."

567
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,750
"Freedom from fear."

568
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:57,080
"Freedom to propagate"?

569
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,250
- That's the new campaign.
- New?

570
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,210
Sounds rather familiar.

571
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,710
Brand-new.

572
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,680
"Procreate to Populate,
with Pride"?

573
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,430
That's the spring rollout to
inspire our young brides to...

574
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,560
Fuck and be fertile?

575
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:14,310
I wouldn't quite put it that way.

576
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,560
This image is perfect for
a message from the Reich.

577
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:22,530
Warmer, more maternal.

578
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,990
Something like...

579
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,780
Forgive my English...

580
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,280
Perhaps... "Now more than ever,
we care about you."

581
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,580
That's not bad.

582
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,870
But let's not get ahead
of ourselves, schatzi.

583
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,250
Agreed. Let's not.

584
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,630
I have thoughts of how to film it.

585
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,540
Yeah, well,
what I was starting to say,

586
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,590
we're-we're doing that in-house.
Got our top people on it.

587
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,050
(laughs)
Silly me. I forgot.

588
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:05,400
My uncle desires a fresh face
for the new propaganda effort

589
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,860
in America.

590
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,410
Reichsminister Goebbels
is your uncle?

591
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:11,740
In a manner of speaking.

592
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,080
I see.

593
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,500
Wunderbar.
So happy you see.

594
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,500
Because we don't have
much time to prepare.

595
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,380
I'll need three cameras,
a crew and a crane.

596
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,750
Danke, schatzi.

597
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,800
See you at the premiere.

598
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:35,810
(crowd chatter, fireworks, rock music in distance)

599
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,190
(sighs)

600
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:48,400
Tru. There's something
I should have said...

601
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,820
months ago.

602
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,410
Then say it.

603
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:54,580
No time like the present.

604
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,550
In this world...

605
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:10,760
in my world...

606
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,260
your father dedicated his life
to the Resistance.

607
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,810
(quietly): And I had to kill him.

608
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:26,520
To stop something terrible
from happening.

609
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,410
Hawthorne told me.

610
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:36,120
The "Dixon" you killed

611
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,490
wasn't my dad.

612
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,000
The Nazis killed my dad in my world.

613
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,420
(sighs)

614
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,050
Hey. You have nothing
to feel bad about.

615
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,970
- Come on.
- (laughs)

616
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,050
Thank you.

617
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,760
You know what?

618
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,930
(both laugh)

619
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,470
What?

620
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,270
I'd kill...

621
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,100
(exhales)

622
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,480
for a little music

623
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,440
and a tall, cold one.

624
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,740
Uh, uh, no.

625
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,410
- No, we c...

626
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:16,740
(whispers):
We can't go out there.

627
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,580

Uh, I'll have another shot

You can buy me a drink.

00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,600

00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,930

Wyatt Price.

657
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,700
Nice to meet you, Wyatt.

658
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,910
Likewise, sister.

659
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,570
So how long do you think
it'll take to get there?

660
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,580
Wing and a Prayer Postal?

661
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:45,330
Sure I could drive you both
to Santa Fe faster.

662
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:49,540
- (laughing): It's 400 miles.
- We could leave tonight.

663
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,040
I thought the roads were full
of bandits and highwaymen.

664
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:54,260
Oh, they are.

665
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,880
It'd be an adventure.

666

(all chuckle)

667
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,470
Right. I think I'll, um,

668
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:04,560
- just drop this in the mail.
- (laughs)

669
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,730
Well, if you won't drive with me
to Santa Fe

670
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:11,310

of the silvery moon,

671
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,480
how about a dance, sister?

672
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,820
No, uh, thank you.

673
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,820
- I think I'm turning in.
- (clears throat)

674
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,490
What about you, Santa Fe?

675
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,410
Would you like
to have a dance with me?

676
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,410
- TRUDY: Go ahead.

- Hmm.

Well, I didn't grow up here.

00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:22,610
Came over with my folks,
to New York, then here.

Hmm. Black market mostly.

- That guy you were talking to.
- Business associate.

- You buying or selling?
- Wee bit of both.

00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:48,120
(sighs softly)

827
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,040
And then I have
to remind myself that,

828
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,670
because of what he did,

829
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:58,040
the message that he sent,

830
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:59,880
he's not ours anymore.

831
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,800
He's not just our Thomas.

832
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:08,010
He kind of belongs
to everyone now, you know?

833
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:11,350
So it's okay to be happy
and sad tomorrow?

834
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:13,180
Yes, of course.

835
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:15,190
Of course.

836
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:18,190
You just try to be brave,
try to...

837
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:20,610
do the best you can,

838
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:23,530
like Thomas would.

839
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:24,990

How could I have missed
such an occasion, Helen?

861
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:56,720
Your son is an inspiration to
the youth of the entire Reich,

- a hero to last a thousand years.
- Mm.

00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,210
It would be appreciated.

871
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,760
It would mean so much.

00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,390

Who is that?

875
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,320
Nicole Dormer.

876
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,240
Daughter of Ernst Dormer.

877
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,820
As in Dormer Pharmaceuticals?

878
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:58,830
I've tried Dormer's sedatives,

879
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:02,410
but I had no idea he made
such world-class stimulants.

880
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:04,410
Introduce me, Edgar.

881
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:08,960
Perhaps later.

882
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,710
You behave.

883
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,840

(urinating)

885
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,570
I'm told to expect a call

00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:32,570
Scheisse.

887
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,070
What's his mood?

888
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,820
Apoplectic.

889
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:37,820
He's particularly upset
about losing

890
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,820
three of his precious Lebensborn.

891
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:41,830
I told you
we should've sent more men.

892
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:44,080
Well, we had to go lean
and mean, George,

893
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:47,250
keep Smith from sniffing this out.

894
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:51,000
Pin the failure of the raid
on a traitor in Smith's office.

895
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,670
You must have shit
on all of 'em.

896
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:56,680
Which I'm saving
for a rainy day.

897
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,840
Edgar,

898
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:01,390
it's about to fucking pour.

899
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:05,430
Look,

900
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,850
whether this shite sticks
to the bottom of his boot

901
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:09,270
or to yours,

902
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,520
Smith has other vulnerabilities.

903
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,280
Mrs. Smith,

904
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,940
who, at 10:00 this morning,

905
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:17,360

of the Reichsmarschall

907
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:21,120
of North America,

908
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,870

Dear friends and neighbors,

930
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,750
we are most privileged
to have with us

931
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:57,340
the Reichsmarschall
of North America,

932
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:00,670
George Lincoln Rockwell.

933
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,820
We gather here today

934
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:27,700
to honor...

935
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:31,000
a true hero of the Reich.

936
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:35,460
When the hour of decision came
for Thomas Smith,

937
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,920
he rose to the occasion

938
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,760
in a way that admirably
reflected upon his father.

939
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:49,060
Without wavering,

940
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:52,060
without self-pity...

941
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:55,440
- Zoom in.
- Thomas Smith, on his own,

942
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,900
made the ultimate sacrifice

943
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:00,650
for a community, a country,

944
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:02,690
a cause.

945
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:06,910
Surely, Thomas Smith

946
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:08,410
shall forever stand

947
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:12,870
a peerless exemplar...

948
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:15,920
of Aryan youth.

949
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,920
And as we remember this day,

950
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,550
let us absorb a great lesson:

951
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:31,390
In the hour of decision,
in the hour of crisis,

952
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:34,520
when we look for leadership,
and for courage,

953
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,480
to whom do we look?

954
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,230
Pan to the Smith family.

955
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:42,650
Are you nuts? I'll be shot.

956
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:43,990
If you don't,
I'll have you shot.

But sometimes,
we are better served

960
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,040
when we look to... a boy.

961
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,330
A boy...

962
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:01,000
with a dream in his heart.
